 # Analyzing Electric Vehicle Charging Habits

This project explores electric vehicle (EV) charging behavior using SQL and Python in a Jupyter Notebook. The analysis focuses on understanding user patterns, garage usage, and charging session dynamics.

## What’s Inside

- SQL queries for EV charging data
- Summary tables of user behavior

## File

- `ev_charging_analysis.ipynb` – Full analysis with SQL code, markdown, and output


## Goals

- Identify heavily used charging locations
- Understand user type distributions
- Practice data analysis with SQL in notebooks
